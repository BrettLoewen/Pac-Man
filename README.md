# PacMan Replica

## Overview

This was a simple project intended to grow my experience with Python. The goal was to create a simple game, very similar to the arcade game PacMan. Many key features of the game were created within the Proof of Concept, a first step where I built a foundation that I could build upon to create the actual game. Once as I made the features I wanted to make as part of the PoC, I moved on to tying those features together and expanding them to create the actual game.

## Running the Game

- Pull down the repo
- Open the project in VS Code
- Open `PacMan/App.py` and press the 'Run' button in the top right
- The game is now running
- To quit, use the window's close button
